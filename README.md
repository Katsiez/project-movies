# Project Movies 🎬 🍿

This week's project was the movies release project. Inspired by the movies' database, this app features a list of popular movies that are clickable and provide descriptions, titles and rating of the movies.

When the user chooses a non-existant path or movie id, they are redirected and presented with a home button that leads them to the start page!

## Tech-stack used:
